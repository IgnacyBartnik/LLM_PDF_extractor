# Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

I've built a  **LLM PDF Extractor** application that xtracts structured data from PDF forms using OpenAI models and presents results through a Streamlit web interface.

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- **PDF Processing**: Multi-page PDF text extraction with validation
- **AI-Powered Extraction**: OpenAI integration for intelligent data extraction
- **Configurable Fields**: Template-based extraction with custom field support
- **Data Persistence**: SQLite database for all extracted data and metadata
- **Web Interface**: Modern Streamlit UI with real-time processing

### Docker & Deployment
- **Containerization**: Full Docker support with optimized images
- **Development & Production**: Separate Docker Compose configurations
- **Volume Management**: Persistent data storage
- **Security**: Non-root containers and resource limits

### Testing & Quality
- **Automated Testing**: Pytest-based test suite with coverage reporting
- **Mock Testing**: External API simulation for reliable testing
- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and type checking support

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Models
```python
# Core schemas for data validation
class ExtractionConfig(BaseModel):
    form_type: str
    extraction_fields: List[str]
    model_name: str = "gpt-4"
    temperature: float = 0.1

class ExtractedData(BaseModel):
    field_name: str
    field_value: str
    confidence_score: Optional[float]
    raw_text: Optional[str]
```

### Service Architecture
```python
# Main orchestration service
class ExtractionService:
    def process_pdf_file(self, file_content, filename, config):
        # 1. Validate PDF
        # 2. Extract text
        # 3. AI processing
        # 4. Store results
        # 5. Return structured data
```
